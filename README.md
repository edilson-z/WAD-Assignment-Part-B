# WAD Assignment Part B Documentation

**By Edilson Zau - 220090491** 


This project aimed to design and implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app. The app should be able to perform basic CRUD functions, authenticate registered users, add new users to a storage system, and query from a backend.

## Development Stack 
For this application the following languages were used: 

* HTML: For creating a basic structure for the application.
* CSS: For adding styles and creating a good UI and UX for users.
* JAVASCRIPT: Used as both a frontend and backend interface, for adding functionality to the application, acting as a storage system for files and user login information, and authenticating users.

## Its key functions should include: 

* Creating files
* Reading files
* Updating files
* Deleting files


To run the files, use VS Code or any other text editor that supports HTML, CSS, and JS files.

## Downloading and opening the files 

*Note these producers will only work if 'git' and 'code' are already installed in your system and added to the environment variables path.*

### Downloading the files

Use the following command on the directory you want to download the files to:
>git clone https://github.com/edilson-z/WAD-Assignment-Part-B.git


### Opening the files

If the download is successful, run the following commands on the same directory that the files were downloaded to:
>code WAD-Assignment-Part-B

<!-- Once the files are downloaded and opened we can now run them on a browser. -->

## Running the application

To successfully run the application, begin by running the "login.html" file and use the credentials:
>email: "danni@gmail.com" 

and 

>password: "12345"

Doing so will take you to the main page "index.html" where all CRUD functions can be performed. 

<br/>
*Note: if an incorrect email or password is entered, the user will not be redirected to the main page.*

<br/>

* On the main page, new files can be created by clicking on the "Add File" button. 

* Files can be read by clicking on the file you wish to read.

* Files can be updated by selecting the file you wish to update and changing its information.

* Files can be deleted by double-clicking the file you wish to delete.
